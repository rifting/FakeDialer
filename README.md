# FakeDialer
An app that can be set as the "default dialing app" for Android. This lacks actual dialing features. This is useful if your device is restricted to calling-only.
This repo contains an example of the "Bad Apple!!" music video to be played on app launch. This app is not meant to be used standalone; rather for you to look at the code and embed it in your own app.
